# mipc-ip-camera

This is to gain access to a cheap chinese IP camera's RTMP stream when it doesn't have the RTSP stream enabled or is not able to be turned on.


Please bare with me with this as this is the first time I am using GITHUB etc.

Fair warning though I am not a programmer at all and I have used ChatGPT to help me with this.
